### Who am I?

Hello! My name is Henrique Ângelo, but most people call me Ângelo, and I prefer that too.


For the past two years, I've gained valuable practical experience as an intern at Rhodia, a chemistry company within the Solvay Group. My primary responsibilities involved maintaining the company's software applications, interacting directly with users, understand their issues, and implement effective solutions. Additionally, I actively participated in several application update projects, providing me valuable insights into the interactions between stakeholders and product suppliers, enhancing my understanding of the software development lifecycle from a broader perspective.

I'm currently in my final year of college, pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. This program has given me a solid foundation in software development principles and practices.

Without doubt, my main interest is BACK-END! I really love to use my creativity to connect tecnlogies and develop smart and performatic solutions.

**My main tecnlogies:**
